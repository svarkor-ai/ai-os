# ARCHITECTURE — AI OS — Tavlor (public read-only boards dashboard)

One subject: how the public dashboard is built, what data contract it consumes, and
where the parts that are NOT in this repo live. Every claim below was checked against
the tracked files at master `6f51344` unless marked UNVERIFIED.

## Model: a static snapshot, no backend

- The page is a **static site**: `index.html` + `static/css/app.css` + two JS files.
  No build step, no framework, no package.json (verified: `git ls-files`).
- The browser issues exactly **one** network request: `fetch('boards.json')`
  (`static/js/app.js:11` `SNAPSHOT_URL`, `app.js:107`). No API call, no token anywhere
  in the repo or the page. The earlier live proxy (and its path-traversal bug) was
  removed entirely (commit `1ee94f1` deleted `app/` and `serve/`).
- `app.js:121` re-fetches every **60 s** (`POLL_MS = 60000`); the page just re-renders
  from the fresh static file.
- If `boards.json` is missing or invalid, `app.js:106-111` sets `state.error` and the
  page renders a graceful Swedish error + "Ingen data." instead of a blank page
  (exercised in the browser during the 2026-09-26 audit: HTTP 404 and invalid JSON
  both degrade gracefully).

## Module map

| File | Concern |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Static shell: topbar, board pills (orchestrator/svarkor), 4 tabs (projekt/beroenden/ko/verifiering), meta bar, panel bodies. Deep links `?board=` / `?tab=` are read by app.js. |
| `static/js/app.js` | Shell ONLY: fetch + 60 s poll, board switch, tab switch, deep-link sync, error state. Holds no rendering logic. |
| `static/js/render.js` | Pure, DOM-free render library (`window.Aos.render` in the browser, `module.exports` under node, render.js:438-439). No network calls, no state. Unit-tested. |
| `static/css/app.css` | Mobile-first styles, status colours, SVG graph styling. |
| `tests/render.test.js` | `node --test` suite for the pure render logic, requiring the REAL `../static/js/render.js`. Run with `node --test tests/render.test.js` (the directory form `node --test tests/` fails on Node v22 — ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT). |
| `hosting.yaml` | vm106 static hosting manifest (`type: static`, root `.`). |

## boards.json contract (what the shipped code actually requires)

Envelope: `generated_at` (timestamp string, app.js:39) and `boards[]`, each board with
`id`, `label`, `hidden_count`, `task_count`, `tasks[]` (app.js:19, 39-42).

Per task (consumed by render.js): `display_id`, `parent_id`, `status`, `project_slug`,
`seat`, `title`, `released`, `after[]`, `onfail[]`, `cycles`, and `verifiable` — the
emitter-stamped structural flag that drives the honest three-way verification split
(render.js:142-155; a `completed_unverified` card without it counts as unverifiable).

The emitter never reads or emits `prompt / result_summary / result_payload / deploy_log /
gate_criteria / model_policy / workdir / acceptance / deploy_spec / notes`, excludes whole
sensitive projects (only an aggregate "N dolda (känsliga)" count is published) and scrubs
titles through `infra/secret_scan.sh`. **That enforcement lives in the emitter, which is
OUTSIDE this repo** — the canonical emitter toolchain (`mc-boards-snapshot.py`,
`validate-hosting.py`, `infra/secret_scan.sh`) is in the agent-town tree on **VM350**
(`/home/claudecode/agent-town-wt/runner-capacity/infra/vm106/repo-visibility-hosting/`).
A stale/partial agent-town copy on other hosts (e.g. the vm105 checkout) may contain only
`minors-denylist.txt` and lack the files. UNVERIFIED from this repo alone: the emitter's
current field list beyond what the code above requires.

## Status vocabulary (render.js:31-45)

The ten REAL board statuses, with Swedish labels and done-flags:

`queued` (I kö) · `claimed` (Tilldelad) · `running` (Pågår) · `blocked` (Blockerad) ·
`waiting_approval` (Väntar godkänn.) · `owner_approved` (Godkänd, done) ·
`completed_unverified` (Klar (overif.), done) · `verified` (Verifierad, done) ·
`deployed` (Driftsatt, done) · `cancelled` (Avbruten, done).

There is no `pending` (the test suite asserts `statusMeta('pending')` falls back to
default). render.js also carries three **defensive extras** — `onfail`, `failed`,
`completed` (render.js:42-44) — so an unexpected status still renders with a sane tone
instead of falling through to "okänd".

## Queue-next rule (render.js:113-138)

A task is "näst på tur" (actionable) when it is `queued`, all its `[after:]` targets have
reached a done state (unknown/pruned deps do not block), and it is `released` — required
unconditionally, dep-free or not (render.js:126, aligned to the README contract by commit
`10ec288`). `queueNext` also
returns `inflight` (claimed/running), `waiting` (queued with unfinished deps) and `gated`
(blocked / waiting_approval).

## Verification tail (render.js:166-179)

`completed_unverified` is split honestly three ways using `verifiable`:
**pending** (has an acceptance bar, awaiting 2x-verify), **unverifiable** (no bar — the
verifier refuses it until a bar is derived), **verified** (`verified`/`deployed`).
`cancelled` is listed separately. The two long tails are capped (verified 60, cancelled
40) and the cap is disclosed in the heading whenever it bites (render.js:313-320).

## Dependency graph (render.js:182-196, 368-420)

`[after:]` and `[onfail:]` tags arrive pre-parsed as `after[]`/`onfail[]` arrays; the
edge list marks deps pointing outside the board as `known:false`. `svgGraph` layers
nodes by longest after-chain depth and draws both edge kinds as an SVG DAG; the edge
list is unit-tested, the SVG layout itself has no direct test (audit note).

## Out of scope of this repo

The emitter, the hosting validator and the secret scan are VM350-side (agent-town tree,
path above). `boards.json` itself is gitignored — it is written into the served web root
by the emitter (atomic ssh write to vm106 in production), never committed.
